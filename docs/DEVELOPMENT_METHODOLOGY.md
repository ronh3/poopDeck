# poopDeck Development Methodology

## Overview

The poopDeck v2.0 OOP conversion was developed using the **Specflow methodology** for AI-assisted software development. This document details the structured approach used to transform a procedural codebase into a robust object-oriented architecture.

## Specflow Methodology Application

### Phase 1: Intent Definition

#### Problem Statement
Convert poopDeck from procedural to object-oriented programming using Lua metatables to improve maintainability, extensibility, and performance.

#### Success Criteria
- All existing functionality preserved
- Improved code organization and maintainability  
- Event-driven architecture for extensibility
- Performance improvements in UI rendering
- Backward compatibility maintained

#### Stakeholder Requirements
- **Users**: No disruption to existing workflows
- **Maintainers**: Cleaner, more organized codebase
- **Future Development**: Extensible architecture for new features

### Phase 2: Roadmap Creation

#### High-Level Phases
1. **Analysis** - Understand current procedural structure
2. **Architecture Design** - Plan OOP class hierarchy
3. **Implementation** - Build core classes systematically  
4. **Integration** - Connect components with events
5. **Migration** - Update existing aliases/triggers
6. **Testing** - Validate complete system functionality

#### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Lua metatable complexity
- **Compatibility Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
- **Performance Risk**: OOP overhead concerns
- **Integration Risk**: Event system complexity

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental development with backward compatibility
- Comprehensive testing at each phase
- Performance benchmarking for critical paths
- Clear rollback strategy if issues arise

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown

#### Implementation Tasks (Completed)
1. ✅ Define intent and success criteria
2. ✅ Analyze procedural codebase structure
3. ✅ Design OOP class hierarchy
4. ✅ Research Lua metatables and patterns
5. ✅ Plan event-driven architecture
6. ✅ Implement Display class with efficiency focus
7. ✅ Implement Config class with persistence
8. ✅ Implement Ship class with state management
9. ✅ Implement SeamonsterCombat class with automation
10. ✅ Create initialization and integration system
11. ✅ Update aliases for OOP usage
12. ✅ Update triggers for event system
13. ✅ Add ship balance and command queueing
14. ✅ Create comprehensive documentation

#### Task Prioritization Strategy
- **Critical Path**: Core classes → Integration → Testing
- **Risk-First**: Most complex components (Combat) early
- **Dependency-Aware**: Config before other classes
- **User-Impact**: Display improvements for immediate benefits

### Phase 4: Execution Strategy

#### Development Approach
- **Iterative Development**: Small, testable increments
- **Backward Compatibility First**: Never break existing functionality
- **Performance Focus**: Optimize critical display paths
- **Event-Driven Integration**: Loose coupling between components

#### Quality Assurance
- **Code Review**: AI-assisted analysis at each step
- **Functional Testing**: Verify each component works
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure classes work together
- **Regression Testing**: Confirm existing features work

#### Human-AI Collaboration Patterns

##### AI Responsibilities
- Code generation following established patterns
- Performance optimization through algorithmic analysis
- Error handling and edge case identification
- Documentation generation from code structure

##### Human Responsibilities  
- Architecture decisions and design direction
- Domain knowledge about game mechanics
- User experience requirements and priorities
- Final validation and acceptance testing

### Phase 5: Refinement Process

#### Continuous Improvement Cycles
1. **Implementation** → **Review** → **Refine** → **Test**
2. **Feedback Integration**: Address issues immediately
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark critical operations
4. **User Experience Validation**: Ensure usability maintained

#### Adaptation Points
- **Display Efficiency**: Identified during Display class review
- **Balance Handling**: Discovered need for command queueing
- **Error Resilience**: Enhanced during Combat class development
- **Event Schema**: Refined based on integration needs

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Code Organization Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each class has one clear purpose
- Methods focused on specific functionality
- Minimal coupling between concerns

#### Open/Closed Principle  
- Classes open for extension via events
- Closed for modification through encapsulation
- Plugin architecture potential

#### Interface Segregation
- Clean public APIs for each class
- Optional functionality clearly separated
- Minimal required dependencies

### Lua-Specific Patterns

#### Metatable Implementation
```lua
local Class = {}
Class.__index = Class

function Class:new(params)
    local self = setmetatable({}, Class)
    -- Initialize instance
    return self
end
```

#### Event Handler Closure Pattern
```lua
function Class:registerEventHandlers()
    local self = self  -- Capture in closure
    registerAnonymousEventHandler("event", function(...)
        self:handleEvent(...)
    end)
end
```

#### Method Chaining Pattern
```lua
function Class:method()
    -- Do work
    return self  -- Enable chaining
end
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy

#### Display System Optimization
1. **Template Pre-calculation**: Build static elements once
2. **Color Inheritance**: Share base colors across schemes
3. **String Operations**: Minimize concatenation, use format
4. **Emoji Handling**: Simplified detection algorithm

#### Memory Management
1. **Object Reuse**: Templates and static data
2. **Timer Cleanup**: Prevent resource leaks
3. **Event Handler Efficiency**: Minimal closure overhead
4. **State Object Design**: Appropriate data structures

### Error Handling Philosophy

#### Defensive Programming
- Input validation at all public interfaces
- State consistency checks before operations
- Graceful degradation when components unavailable
- Clear error messages for debugging

#### Recovery Strategies
- Combat system cleanup on errors
- Display fallbacks for rendering issues
- Config validation with repair
- Event system isolation

## Quality Assurance Methodology

### Testing Approach

#### Component-Level Testing
- **Display**: Visual output verification
- **Config**: Persistence and validation testing
- **Ship**: State management and command execution
- **Combat**: Automation and error handling

#### Integration Testing
- **Event Flow**: Trigger → Event → Response verification
- **State Synchronization**: Prompt updates reflected properly
- **Cross-Component**: Classes working together correctly

#### System-Level Testing
- **Full Workflows**: Complete sailing and combat scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: External kills, interruptions, errors
- **Performance**: Display rendering under load
- **Compatibility**: Existing aliases still function

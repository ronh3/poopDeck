# üö¢ poopDeck User Guide

Your complete guide to using the poopDeck seafaring automation system in Achaea.

## üéØ Quick Start

### Essential Commands
```lua
poopsail      # Show sailing commands
poopfish      # Show fishing commands  
poopmonster   # Show seamonster commands
poopfull      # Show ALL commands
```

## üé£ Fishing System

The poopDeck fishing system is designed to be **intelligent and resilient**, automatically handling common fishing scenarios.

### Basic Fishing Commands

```lua
# Start fishing with defaults
fish

# Start with specific bait and cast distance  
fish bass medium
fish shrimp long
fish worms short

# Stop fishing
stopfish

# View detailed statistics
fishstats
```

### Fishing Configuration

```lua
# Set default bait (accepts any bait type)
fishbait bass
fishbait shrimp
fishbait <any_bait_you_have>

# Set bait source
fishsource tank        # Get bait from a tank
fishsource inventory   # Use bait from inventory  
fishsource fishbucket  # Get bait from fishbucket

# Set default cast distance
fishcast short    # Close to shore - faster bites
fishcast medium   # Balanced distance (default)
fishcast long     # Far from shore - potentially better fish

# Toggle auto-restart when fish escape (RECOMMENDED: ON)
fishrestart
```

### üîÑ Auto-Resume Feature (Key Feature!)

The system **automatically restarts fishing** when fish escape for any reason:

- **Automatic**: Detects when fish get away
- **Smart Delays**: 5-second delay between restart attempts
- **Retry Limits**: Up to 3 automatic retries per escape
- **Persistent**: Tracks statistics across all restart attempts
- **Reliable**: Works with any escape reason (line snapped, fish too strong, etc.)

**Example Scenario:**
```
[You cast your line...]
The fish snaps your line and escapes!
üîÑ Fish escaped (line snapped). Auto-restarting... (Attempt 1/3)
[System waits 5 seconds then automatically casts again]
```

### Fishing Statistics

```lua

## üì¢ Prompt Management & Spam Reduction

Intelligent message filtering to reduce screen clutter during sailing.

### Quiet Mode

```lua
poopquiet      # Toggle quiet mode (suppresses sailing prompts)

# When enabled:
# - Ship movement prompts are suppressed
# - Important messages still shown
# - Periodic summaries provided
```

### Prompt Statistics

```lua
poopprompts    # View detailed prompt management stats

# Example output:
=== Prompt Management Statistics ===
Total Messages: 1,247
Displayed: 892 (71.5%)
Suppressed: 355 (28.5%)
  - Quiet Mode: 201
  - Duplicates: 89  
  - Throttled: 65
=== Configuration ===

Throttle Interval: 2s
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration

### Health and Safety

```lua
poophp 75      # Set health threshold (default: 75%)
poophp 80      # More conservative setting
poophp 90      # Very conservative (recommended for novices)
```

**How it works:**
- System monitors your health via GMCP
- Stops firing when health drops below threshold  
- Automatically turns curing on
- Resumes when health recovers

### Maintenance Preferences

```lua
# Set automatic maintenance during combat
mainh          # Always maintain hull during seamonster fights
mains          # Always maintain sails during seamonster fights  
mainn          # No automatic maintenance
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Recovery

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

### Automatic Recovery

- **Fishing Failures**: Auto-restart with fresh equipment
- **Combat Interruptions**: Automatic retry after delays
- **Navigation Errors**: State reset and recovery
- **Service Crashes**: Automatic service restart

### Error Categories

1. **Fishing Errors**: Equipment, location, or command issues
2. **Combat Errors**: Weapon, health, or range problems  
3. **Navigation Errors**: Movement or ship state issues
4. **System Errors**: Service communication or initialization

### Viewing Errors

Errors are handled automatically, but you can review them:
- Check Mudlet's error console for detailed logs
- System provides user-friendly error messages
- Recovery attempts are logged and reported

## üìä Statistics & Monitoring

### Fishing Statistics
```lua
fishstats      # Comprehensive fishing data
resetfishstats # Clear all fishing statistics
```

### System Status

```

## üéÆ Gameplay Integration

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic fishing and sailing
2. **Test Safely**: Try features in safe areas first
3. **Monitor Health**: Keep health threshold reasonable
4. **Use Windows**: Status windows provide valuable information
5. **Check Statistics**: Review fishing stats to optimize setup

### Typical Workflow

```lua
# 1. Basic setup
poophp 80
fishbait bass
fishsource tank

# 2. Start activities
fish              # Begin fishing
autosea           # Enable seamonster auto-fire
poopwindows       # Show status windows

# 3. Monitor and adjust
fishstats         # Check fishing performance
poopprompts       # Review message management
```
